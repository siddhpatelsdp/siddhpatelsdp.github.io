    <p>
        This course introduces students to building websites by combining HTML and CSS to create well-structured and visually appealing designs. 
        Students will also use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality. Later, they will work with Node.js and server-side JavaScript to manage 
        data storage and retrieval on the backend.
