            <p>For this assignment, I created a webpage based on a topic of my choice. The goal was to practice basic HTML structure and include several elements such as a main heading, paragraphs, images, a list, a table, and external links. I made sure to follow proper HTML syntax, including a doctype declaration, a title tag, and a comment with my name and course information. This assignment also helped me understand how to organize files and folders properly.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, I created a webpage on a topic of my choice, incorporating CSS to improve the pageâ€™s design. I added a navigation bar with four links, changed the font, and applied a color scheme that matched the content. The page includes an h1 title, an h2 subheader, two paragraphs, two images, and a table with three columns and five rows. I styled the navigation links, images, and table with padding, borders, and background colors to enhance the layout. I used element, id, and class selectors to apply consistent styling, and ensured the page had a readable, cohesive design with a background image.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, I created a webpage that uses CSS Flexbox to lay out content in both column and navbar formats. The page includes essential HTML5 elements like header, footer, nav, section, aside, and article. I created a navigation bar with links using the nav, ul, and li elements. The layout was structured according to the provided diagram, with the content properly adjusting for both large and small screen sizes using media queries. I added background colors and padding to the navigation items and columns for better visual appeal, ensuring the margins and spacing matched the example while maintaining a cohesive design.</p>
